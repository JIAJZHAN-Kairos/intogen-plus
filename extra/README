IntOGen pipeline extra content
==============================

In this document you can find scripts that we have used to do some
postprocessing of our data.
This is completely dependent of your own run, but here we provide instructions
in case you want to similar (or the same) things.

The Makefile will execute all this postprocessing of the data.


Requirements:

bgparsers
numpy
pandas
pytabix


Note that the count_samples.txt and count_variants.txt files
do not have dependencies, as it is not that easy to track all the files.
Those files must be manually deleted if you want them to be updated.
